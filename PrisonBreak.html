<h1>Prison Break</h1>
<p>This game has gone through many stages of development. I worked alongside a colleague, Owusu Bonsu, to develop this game. <br>
Prison Break first started out as a text-based game about navigating to find items that would aid in the escape of a Russian Gulag. <br>
Initially this game was a great resource to host our knowledge of web development and skills such as html, css, and javascript. <br>
As the knowledge and skills began to improve, the game could follow suit. The idea of the text-based game soon transitioned into a Unity engine<br>
developed game. Many aspects of the game came along with the new development, but this transition allowed for new knowledge to be gained. <br>

Through the years of Prison Break, my personal fascination with front-end development came into play. Developing this new Unity game needed aspects
of design <br> both in layout and character that were based on the setting of the game.
