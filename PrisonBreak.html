<h1>Prison Break</h1>
<p>Prison Break has gone through many stages of development. I worked alongside a colleague, Owusu Bonsu, to develop this game. <br>
Prison Break first started out as a text-based game about navigating to find items that would aid in users' the escape from a Russian Gulag. <br>
Initially, this game was a great resource to host our knowledge and skills of web development through html, css, and javascript. <br>
As our knowledge and skills began to improve, the game could follow suit. The idea of the text-based game soon transitioned into a Unity engine<br>
developed game. Many aspects of the game were changed the new development, but this transition allowed for experience with Unity game development. <br>
Through the years of Prison Break, my personal fascination with front-end development came in handy. My knowledge of design and front-end development <br>
were useful when developing the game's layout and characters, providing a better grasp of the game's setting for the user.
