<h1>Arty Leger Salem Baseball</h1>
  <p>
  I created this simple website for a friend who is planning on attending Salem University to play baseball. I put together a small
  webpage that will host most of his stats and other information, updating once his first season begins in the fall of 2021. This page 
  was mainly to test a new feature I came across on Apple's page. Apple uses the feature 3D render on scroll animation on the Airpod Pro 
  website. For this page, the scroll animation is applied to a video of the player at batting practice. I had a fun time constructing 
  this and he was super excited on this feature. The other aspects will be modified to look more professional once his stats and achievements 
  start rolling in.
