  This a redesign concept for The Dyslexia Foundation donation page. I was reading an article about how comic sans makes words <br>
  easier to read for people with dyslexia. Given this, I decided to create a page that would be centered around this idea. Going <br>
  to the original page, it is very basic and does not give a clear and direct scope. This was the first webpage I designed and this <br>
  concept was for my own knowledge, to gain an understanding of design and experience through Figma. There was study of people with <br>
  dyslexia and their performance, many of the subjects chose mucky green and brown as a good combination along with blue and yellow as another. <br>
  The original page does display these aspects some, however I wanted there to be a more vibrant image associated buttons to help with <br>
  the process. With this, I also took the three-section webpage and condensed it into one. This has its pros and cons, with easy accessibility<br>
  but limited space for extra information. I will link the official page below and reiterate that this has no affiliation with The Dyslexia Foundation. <br>
