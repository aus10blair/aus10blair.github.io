  This is a redesign concept for The Dyslexia Foundation donation page. I was reading an article about how the comic sans font makes words <br>
  easier to read for people with dyslexia. Given this information, I decided to create a webpage redesign of THe Dyslexia Foundatoin donation page.<br>
  The original donation page is very basic and does not give a clear and direct path for the donation process. There was a study of people with <br>
  dyslexia and their performance, many of the subjects chose mucky green and brown as a good combination for design along with blue and yellow as another. <br>
  The original page does display these aspects some. However, I wanted there to be a more drastic representation of color and comic sans for the buttons to help with <br>
  the deciphering process. With this, I also took the three-section webpage and condensed it into one. This has its pros and cons, with easy accessibility<br>
  but limited space for extra information. This was the first webpage I designed and this concept was for my own knowledge, to gain an understanding of design <br>
  and experience through Figma. I linked the official donation page below and reiterate that this has no affiliation with The Dyslexia Foundation. <br>
