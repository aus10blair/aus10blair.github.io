  <p style="color:#FFFF">
  This a redesign concept for the Sunnyside* webpage. I camne across this website and was confused at my first glance. <br>
  They did not have any feature that stood out suggesting what the business was selling. As this was my first major redesign, I tried <br>
  to keep some of their aspects so it would not be a told rebranding for the company. The color scheme did not give a hint towards this <br>
  being a cannabis website either. At first, I wanted to redesign using their original orange for the Sunnyside* feature with a green for <br>
  cannabis. The colors I were putting together did not look professional nor clean within the website. I decided to go with a burble to accompany <br>
  this exisiting orange color. On their homepage, the was no mention of cannabis only smaller products that could be related to this. Next to the <br>
  text, there was an image of a small sun between fingers, my take was this was for a cannabis nugget of the flower. I like the image but changed <br>
  up the text to make what they were selling pop, and provided a farm in the background of their original image to associate with growing the product.<br>
  I gave them a small slogan of, "Start your day off on the right side ..." which would top with "Sunnyside*". With this I created seperation of the <br>
  company name and the tabs availiable to find what the user is looking for easier. On the bottom of each page, I added another saying, "Cannabis shopping<br>
  made simple." to further emphasize the product being sold to the user. With this, I created buttons that linked all their social medias, which would <br>
  create a more friendly and interative setting for the user. I will link the official page below and reiterate that this has no affiliation with Sunnyside*. <br> <br>
