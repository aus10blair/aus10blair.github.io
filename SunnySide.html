<h1 style="color: #FF9800;">Sunnyside* Concept</h1>
  <p style="color:#FFFF">
  This is a redesign concept for the Sunnyside* webpage. At first glance, this website was a bit confusing. There were not  any features that stood <br> 
   suggesting what the business was selling. As this was my first major redesign, I tried to keep some of their original aspects so it would not be a total <br>
   rebranding for the company. I have linked the official page below and reiterate that this has no affiliation with Sunnyside*. (Note they have changed some features since my redesign.) <br>
   <a href="https://www.sunnyside.shop/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF9800;">Sunnyside*</a>
   <br>
  <br> <br> <br> 
  <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Home Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">
  The color scheme did not give any hints of this being a cannabis website. At first, I wanted to redesign using their original orange color <br> 
  for the Sunnyside* (egg) connection while adding green for cannabis. However, the colors I put together did not look professional nor clean within the website. <br>
  I decided to go with a purple to compliment the existing orange hue. On their homepage, there was no mention of cannabis, only smaller products  <br>
  relating to cannabis. Next to the text on this page, there was a sun positioned between two fingers and my take was that this graphic represented a nugget <br> 
  of cannabis flower. I liked the original image but added a farm graphic to represent growing the product. I changed the text to contain the word cannabis.<br>
  I set up a small slogan of, "Start your day off on the right side ..." which plays off the "Sunnyside*" (egg) breakfast theme. On the bottom of each page, I <br> 
  added another saying, "Cannabis shopping made simple." to further emphasize the product being sold. With this, I created buttons that linked all their social medias, <br>
   which provides a more friendly and interactive setting for the user.

 <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Shop Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">
   For the shop page, there is a visual image representing each product, which helps guide the user. The visual image makes the product stand out and <br>
   helps direct new/inexperienced users. The name of each product is underneath the corresponding image. The name of the product is in a clickable button <br>
    that transitions into a more detailed product page. As you can see with the "Flower" button being highlighted, given that it is clicked, it will <br>
   take the user to the more detailed page. <br> <br>

  <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Flower Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">
   The new designed, more detailed, "Flower" page needed to have more contrast between the background and the product than the original Sunnyside* page. This darker purple <br>
    supplied a great contrast between the variety of flower products displayed.I designed the titles for each products' strain in the top left corner to provide an easy indicator <br>
   for the users. Under the product image are strain names and details on the dosages within flower. The white text color on the darker purple background, separated by orange lines, <br> 
   separates the information of the product. This design makes reading the information easier on the eyes for the user. The arrow in the bottom right is intended to be used <br>
   for scrolling through the variety of flower Sunnyside* has to offer. The choice of the colors for the titles correlate to the effects of each strain on the individual. For example, <br>
   Indica is a mellow high so it is represented by a dull white color. Sativa is a more active and hyper high, making the vibrant orange a good representation for its effects. Combining <br>
   the two and getting the Hybrid strain, this strain still has the calmness of the Indica idcated by the purple background, while also having that more active effect from the Sative <br>
   indicated bu the vibrant orange in the text.

  <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Guide Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">
   For the guide pages, I changed the images to have a more detailed depiction of the cannabis flower. The original Sunnyside* picture fit the <br> 
    new page design, however I replaced it with the extra image to give more options for the company. I liked the orignal layout but designed the <br>
    buttons to stand out more to the user. As each button containing the product is clicked, information about the selected product will appear underneath <Br>
    in an orange text. I tried the lighter purple color, instead of white, for the buttons' background, but it did not provide enough contrast to the darker purple background.

 <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Map Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">
   The main feature that needed to be added to the original map page was an actual gps map within the webpage. I placed the map on the left of the page and the information for the selected store to <br>
   be place on the right. This gives the user to optionto select their desired store and then receiving the information about that location. For the new map page design, I created the features to pop <br>
   out at the user. However, my design for the information of the selected store could be more vertically spaced out. More vertically spacing gives the user more room for error when trying to precisely <br>
   click on the desired button such as "Store Details" or "Contact Us".

 <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">Bottom Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#FFFF">s
    The original layout for this Sunnyside* page was fine, it just needed to be adapted to the new color scheme. Given that I did not have access to the original image for the variety of forms, I <br>
    just used the ones already on the page by cropping them and adjusting their positioning. The middle section with "Forms" and "Collections" get lost in the background on the original design, while <br>
    keeping them as a secondary eye-catcher, they still contrast better with the darker purple background.
