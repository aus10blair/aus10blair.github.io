   The Shade Room is the first project where I oversaw the User Interface. Along with a very helpful group to collaborate on this application, <br>
   I did research on the functionality of my design. During this time period, I got into a car accident which caused a setback on my production and <br>
   knowledge obtained. The Shade Room's focus was to develop an Android Studio mobile application that would challenge the user to identify the <br>
   square containing the darkest shade of a random color provided. Initially, the gameplay screen was a simple constraint-construction in Android Studio <br>
   which turned out to be the best part of my final design. This application sparked my interest in User Interface and front-end development. When I fell <br> 
   short in performance, designing pages that I and the client felt were subpar to the actual game concept, I decided to improve my knowledge and experience <br>
   with User Interface. This project was a learning experience and highlighted my design and development weaknesses. A major weakness was the color scheme because <br>
   of my harsh hexadecimal color codes decisions. The vectors of the Home Screen and the High Score screen are not up to standards for a functioning Android application. <br>
   Although this app ran smoothly, the color scheme and the vectors are harsh on the eyes. The harshness can be seen in the images of the screens below. Along with this, <br>
   I did not get to complete the animation <br> of the squares at the bottom of the Home Screen. These squares were intended to be moving around, bouncing off the screenâ€™s boundaries constantly.   <br><br>

  Below are the images of the Home Screen and the High Score screen along with gameplay of The Shade Room application.  <br><br>
