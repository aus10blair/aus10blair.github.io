   The Shade Room was the first project that I oversaw the User Interface. Along with a very helpful group to collaborate on this application, <br>
   I did research on the functionality of my design. During this time period I got into a car accident which caused a setback on my projection and <br>
   knowledge obtained. The Shade Room's focus was to develop an Android Studio mobile application that would challenge the user to identify the <br>
   square containing the darkest shade of the color provided. Initially, the actual gameplay area was a simple constraint construction which turned out to  <br>
   be the best part of that I designed. <br>
   This application sparked my interest in User Interface and front-end development. When I fell short in performance, designing pages that I and the client felt were <br>
   subpart to the actual game concept, I decided that I would shift my focus in career to User Interface. This project was a learning experience and I wanted <br>
   to improve on this weakness because of my interested in the field. The color scheme was not the best giving the harsh hexadecimal color codes I chose. Along with <br>
   this in the Home Screen and the High Score screen the vectors are not up to standard for a functioning Android application. Although this app worked and ran smoothly <br>
  the importance of collaboration, communication, and creativity. As you can see from the images of the screens, the design needed a lot of improvement. The colors and <br>
  vectors are harsh. Along with this I did not get to complete the animation of the squares at the bottom of the Home Screen. These squares were intended to be moving <br> 
  around bouncing off the screenâ€™s boundaries constantly.   <br><br>

  Below are images of the Home Screen and High Score screen I designed along with gameplay of The Shade Room.  <br><br>
