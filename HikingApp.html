<h1 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Hiking Application</h1>
  <p style="color:#A2BFBD"> This application was my second Android Mobile application. For this project, I was in charge of the complete front-end and became the <br>
    Scrum master for our Agile project after the second cycle. This project demonstrated the importance of communication in a group project. </br>
    There were constant meetings where I would be the only person in attendance. A co-team lead in the first cycle started out strong sending emails and </br>
    setting up a Discord server but after that fell short. One of the toughest parts was gathering the group to discuss the scope of the project. </br>
    As I produced a design for the app using Figma, I received no feedback from the group which hindered my ability to complete the aspects needed in </br>
    the front-end. I received great feedback from the client on my work as I progressed. As the communication stayed subpart, I took on the front-end part </br>
    with full ambition. This in the end was significant to meeting the deadline of the project. During this I had to pick up the slack of the </br>
    back-end developers and coded some back-end to accommodate my work such as the login screens password qualification error message. The lack of work </br>
    contributed from the other parties ended up not allow this app to reach its full potential especially on the database side. These were some of the </br>
    problems that this project made me aware of for future group endeavors. </br></br>

<h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Login Page</h2>
    <p style="color:#A2BFBD">
    To start, I wanted to have a design that would be simple for the users and developers. I played around with a few color schemes and ended on a green <br>
    variety to associate with the environment for the user to easily identify. I designed the login screen to start to try and get a design and layout  <br>
    for the application's scope. I wanted a recognizable logo, so I went with a simple globe logo and the name of my team which was Group9.  </br>
    The next step was to fill in a login design inspired by other designers with having a logo and a less vibrant word of the task need to be completed </br>
    by the user. The design choice of having a vibrant "Login" button easy for the members who had previously signed up for the app while having options to 
    become a member "Join Now". <br>
    A "Forgot Password" button because everyone has forgotten a password in one instance or another so this is a must in designs. At the bottom of this screen <br> 
    I combined a few svg images to create an image of a man hiking, relating to the application's scope and to fill the white space. I played around and tried to <br>
     create other options, like with the man on the mountain but the vectors would not line up in a way that I was pleased with, so I pushed for the no mountains design. <br><br>

<h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Home Screen</h2>
  <p style="color:#A2BFBD">    
  The next screen I started to design was the home page. With that, I implemented a "Welcome userName" screen that would allow processing time <br>
  for the app to locate exsisting members information, data, or log new memeber data. This page was not implemented in the final product.  <br>
  Through this transition of the "Welcome userName" screen, an animation of the "userName" sliding up and replacing the "Group9" location would be performed. <br>
  This feature would also have to be omitted from the final product due to problems faced within the cycles of the project. Despite these setbacks the following <br>
  screens were designed: Downloaded Maps, Calendar, Weather Forecast, Gear List, and Emergency Contact. 
  <br> <br>

  Initially, my ideas for the screens were looking unprofessional and harsh on the eyes. Taking a step back, I realized that having buttons navigating <br>
  through the application's pages would be easy on developers and users. The home page displays snippits of information from the other pages within the application. <br>
  This information is displayed on clickable shortcut buttons that, when clicked take you to a more detailed page for the content. After a layout that I was pleased with. I shared it with <br>
  the team. The team, please with my work, gave zero criticism limiting the improvement of the application to my own opinion. The images below display the draft concepts <br> 
  that became the final application. The only difference in design and final product was minimal aspects in the Android Studio coding development stage. <br> <br>

  <h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Map Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#A2BFBD"> The map page required the most collaboration, within the group, to understand the goal for the final product. Since the communication was little to none <br>
    by the group, I created a searching feature, a manage maps feature, and an altitude tracker. These aspects were deemed useful by the collective when I added them to the product's backlog.  <br>
    To accompany this page, extended pages would store the previously stated aspects with a scroll feature implemented to navigate through the added pages. The additional pages can be found below. <br>
    Within these additional pages below are designs I created that the group never implemented on the back-end and database side. The first shown is a map selection page which allows the user to <br?
    click/swipe via the arrows to select the desired region. After selecting the region, trail maps would appear allowing the user to click for more detail. This concept was not used as being too <br> 
    difficult to get into production. I designed two concepts of this specific map page because my original did not show the selected area as a vibrant color when highlighted. I switched the vibrant <br>
    and dull shades because the brighter color stands out more for the user's selection. The switch can seen in frames 8-11 (on the right), with the highlighted region being vibrant green.  <br><br>

   <h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Weather Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#A2BFBD">  I designed the weather page to display the weekly forecast. This is because when looking to plan a hiking trip, weather is a major factor. I gave significance to the <br>
    current day by highlighting it in vibrant green. Below the days of the week for the forecast, the back-end and database needed to develop a grab of data from a weather outlet depending on the users' <br>
    location. Underneath this weekly forcast feature, there is a button placeholder for a clickable link that would take you to articles, tutorials, equipment, etc, that would aid in a survival situation. <br>
    Towards the bottom of this page, there is a placeholder clickable that takes you directly to the website of your local news station. <br>   
   
   </p>

   <h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Information Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#A2BFBD"> The information page is disigned to display more articles and important information realted to hiking. This page has placeholders for information about recommended gear, more <br>
    safety tips, and other important information. This important information could range from defective saftey equipment to new accomplishments in areas relating to hiking.  
   
   
     </p>

   <h2 style="color:#AFFFB3;">Settings Page</h2>
   <p style="color:#A2BFBD">  If you click on the link to get more details on the project, you will find a video of the final project created by the other members in the team. <br> 
   Due to the database team not getting any significant work done, I created a last second page to replace the weather page. There were no development efforts made by the database <br>
   tean to gather weather data or member data for the application. This changed the design of the settings button being a drop down in the top left corner to beinging a simple <br>
     "Save and Cancel" clickable-text screen for users. <br>
